# Login-Form
Login Page with Background Image and Redirect
This is a beginner-friendly login page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a full-screen background image, a centered login form, and a simple login validation system that redirects to a dashboard page upon successful login.

How It Works
1. The user enters a **username** and **password**.
2. JavaScript checks the input against hardcoded credentials (`Bond` / `007`).
3. If correct → the user is redirected to `welcome.html`.
4. If incorrect → an error message is displayed on the login page.
